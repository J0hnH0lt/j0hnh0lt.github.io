                        Hi Sarah! This will be a collection of resources explaining ADHD on a clinical and academic level. 
                        It may be excerpts from web articles, links to videos, links to PDFs. I will source everything I 
                        add so you can look into it if you like. I am making this because I know you love to read and I 
                        hope it will better help you understand what I mean when I say "I have ADHD". I never mean it as 
                        an excuse, only as an explaination to why something is more challenging for me than it appears. <br>

                            This TEDx talk is a good place to start. Similar to my experience, but also the reason why I am eager to explain what it is 
                            that I have and what is means to me.

                            This Dr does a lot of talks about what ADHD looks like from a more academic and clinic standpoint and his talk about parenting ADHD children
                            was actually one of the first videos I found after getting diagnosed. It was my first step in understanding what I had and how to build systems
                            so that I could survive as a new member of the ADD/ADHD community. However that talk is about 3hrs long and I don't know if you want to commit 
                            to that, so I am starting with this. (Plus not trying to teach you how to parent me ;) ) However, you may see it pop up in here in clips.

                            (Bare with me. I need go through this content before adding it and videos are easier for me than papers, but I still plan on finding some good 
                            ones for you. Don't you worry :D )

                            The second moving to your right is the spring rope. This is simply 10 spring pairs linked together with the 2 ends being anchored on either side. I have also rendered the springs (lines) between each spring mass particle.

                            After that is the Boids system. I chose to color them gray to make distinguishing between different boid particles easier. The way I decided to handle the boundaries was by moving the particle to the opposite side if it reached an edge.

                            Then following that is a simple bouncy ball simulation. This is the best and most obvious system to see the differences in solvers between the midpoint solver, the Euler solver, and the original particle solver from the bouncy ball starter code.

                            Lastly, I have a rain simulation. Although I did not have time to get a sphere drawn in the VBO, there is a sphere constraint in the center of the box. As the particles fall, if they hit the sphere, they roll off it along the spheres surface.
