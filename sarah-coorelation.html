                        Hi Sarah! This will (hopefully) be a collection of accounts of people's exerpiences that I think 
                        coorelate with my own experience. It may be excerpts from web articles, links to videos, or even 
                        just me writing things down. I will source everything I add so you can look into it if you like. 
                        I am making this because I know you love to read and I hope that this will help give you a bit 
                        of insight into where I am coming from and the certain light my brain casts the world in.  <br>

                            The second moving to your right is the spring rope. This is simply 10 spring pairs linked together with the 2 ends being anchored on either side. I have also rendered the springs (lines) between each spring mass particle.

                            Although it is hard to see in a picture, the next is the tornado. It has gravity, drift and a swirling wind force acting on it.

                            After that is the Boids system. I chose to color them gray to make distinguishing between different boid particles easier. The way I decided to handle the boundaries was by moving the particle to the opposite side if it reached an edge.

                            Then following that is a simple bouncy ball simulation. This is the best and most obvious system to see the differences in solvers between the midpoint solver, the Euler solver, and the original particle solver from the bouncy ball starter code.

                            Second to last I have my Reeve's Fire simulation. This has a fountain at the base and as the particles age they shift color from yellow to red before being reset.

                            Lastly, I have a rain simulation. Although I did not have time to get a sphere drawn in the VBO, there is a sphere constraint in the center of the box. As the particles fall, if they hit the sphere, they roll off it along the spheres surface.
