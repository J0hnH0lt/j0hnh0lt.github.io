                        Hi Sarah! This will (hopefully) be a collection of accounts of people's exerpiences that I think 
                        coorelate with my own experience. It may be excerpts from web articles, links to videos, or even 
                        just me writing things down. I will source everything I add so you can look into it if you like. 
                        I am making this because I know you love to read and I hope that this will help give you a bit 
                        of insight into where I am coming from and the certain light my brain casts the world in.  <br>
